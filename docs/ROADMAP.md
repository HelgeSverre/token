Planned features and improvements for rust-editor.

For completed work, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
For archived phases, see [archived/old-roadmap-file.md](archived/old-roadmap-file.md).

## Recently Completed

### Multi-Cursor Movement ✅

**Design:** [feature/MULTI_CURSOR_MOVEMENT.md](feature/MULTI_CURSOR_MOVEMENT.md) | **Completed:** 2025-12-06

All cursor movement operations now work with multiple cursors:

- Arrow keys, Home/End, Word navigation, Page Up/Down move ALL cursors
- Shift+movement extends selection for ALL cursors
- Cursor deduplication when cursors collide
- Each cursor preserves its own `desired_column`
- 10 new tests in `tests/cursor_movement.rs`

---

## Planned Features

### Expand/Shrink Selection

**Design:** [feature/TEXT-SHRINK-EXPAND-SELECTION.md](feature/TEXT-SHRINK-EXPAND-SELECTION.md)

Progressive selection expansion:

- Option+Up: Expand (word → line → all)
- Option+Down: Shrink (restore previous)
- Selection history stack

### File Dropping

**Design:** [feature/handle-file-dropping.md](feature/handle-file-dropping.md)

Drag-and-drop file handling:

- Handle `WindowEvent::DroppedFile` and `HoveredFile` from winit
- Visual overlay during drag hover
- Open files in tabs, switch to existing if already open
- Binary file detection and size limits

### Workspace Management

**Design:** [feature/workspace-management.md](feature/workspace-management.md)

CLI arguments and file tree sidebar:

- Support `red file1 file2` for multiple files
- Support `red ./src` to open directory as workspace
- File tree sidebar with expand/collapse
- File system watching for external changes
- Dependencies: `clap` for CLI, `notify` for FS watching

### Codebase Organization

**Design:** [ORGANIZATION-CODEBASE.md](ORGANIZATION-CODEBASE.md)

Restructure large files for maintainability:

- Convert `update.rs` to `update/` module directory
- Extract from `main.rs`: `view.rs`, `app.rs`, `input.rs`, `perf.rs`
- Target: `main.rs` ~100-200 lines, update submodules ~400-600 lines each

### Undo Coalescing (Future)

Group rapid consecutive edits into single undo entries:

- Time-based grouping (e.g., 300ms threshold)
- Coalesce consecutive character insertions
- Break on cursor movement or pause
- Improves undo ergonomics for normal typing
