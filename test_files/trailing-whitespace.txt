hmm when focusing on the cursor/adjuting the viewprot the "directionality" of where the cursor is moving and where the
viewport is in relation to the cursor matters as if we have scrolled below viewport, and press up, this will not focus
cursor since it only looks for down, however this should trigger the ensure cursor visible as well, same with if you move
cursor to near end, scroll far up and press up, i belive there is a referenc eto how cursor behaves in these scenarios etc
in @docs/EDITOR_UI_REFERENCE.md  5.1 Scroll Margins / Keep-in-View Zone and 5.5 Scroll Reveal Strategies which is relevant
