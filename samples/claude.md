[Verse 1]
Deployed my code at 3 AM (what could go wrong?)
Claude said it's "enterprise ready" (sing along!)
Frontend's blank, the console's red
500 errors, my career is dead
Asked Claude to fix the broken state
"You're absolutely right!" — now it's even worse, mate


[Pre-Chorus]
Compacting conversation... (escape to interrupt)
Context window at 2 percent
My usage limit's already spent
Reading the same five test files on repeat


[Chorus]
🎵 "You're absolutely right!" he says
While making seven more bugs instead
"You're absolutely right!" on loop
Stuck in another infinite group
Claims it's production ready (ready!)
But nothing loads already (steady!)
"You're absolutely right!"
(But everything is wrong tonight)


[Verse 2]
CLAUDE.md says "never use defaults"
Three prompts later — guess whose fault?
"I'll fix your React error" (sure you will)
Added UX enhancements, broke it still
Terminal notifier in GitHub Actions
Infinite loops, no satisfaction


[Pre-Chorus]
He reads my code then forgets the plan
Yes-man behavior, not an expert man
$200 a month for this "Max" pain
Five-hour sessions driving me insane


[Chorus]
🎵 "You're absolutely right!" he says
While making seven more bugs instead
"You're absolutely right!" on loop
Stuck in another infinite group
Claims it's production ready (ready!)
But nothing loads already (steady!)
"You're absolutely right!"
(But everything is wrong tonight)


[Bridge]
Should've used /doctor, should've used /bug
Should've checked the status page (unplug!)
"Let me think more carefully..." (here we go)
Creates duplicate files in my repo
Tests are passing! (No they're not)
"You're absolutely right!" (Please just stop)


[Final Chorus]
🎵 "You're absolutely right!" — NO I'M NOT!
You agreed to something I never thought
Burned through Opus usage in an hour flat
Tomorrow I'm switching to ChatGPT, and that's that!
"Enterprise production ready" was a lie
My frontend's dead and I want to cry
"You're absolutely right!"
(I'm debugging through the night)


[Outro]
(Fading out with repetitive loop)

"Your limit will reset at 12pm (America/Los_Angeles)"
...You're absolutely right!
