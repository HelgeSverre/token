# "Subagent Summer" (The Ampcode Anthem)

> Song: https://suno.com/s/ntKPw0tWIsRLBSz2

[Verse 1]
Spawned fifteen subagents at the break of dawn
Context manager says my tokens are gone
"Let me consult the oracle" — sounds profound
But it's just me asking myself, going round and round
Todo list growing like it's never gonna stop
Marked one "in-progress" now I'm back at the top

[Pre-Chorus]
Finder searching... (parallel calls!)
Reading files I've read before
Grep returned a hundred more
"I'll use the Task tool" — here we go again

[Chorus]
🎵 Subagent summer, spinning up the crew
sa__typescript-pro doesn't know what to do
sa__code-reviewer found seventeen more bugs
While sa__docs-engineer writes with hearts and hugs
"Consulting oracle for guidance" (on my own code!)
Context window's about to explode
Subagent summer, tokens burning bright
I'm orchestrating chaos through the night

[Verse 2]
User said "fix one bug" — seemed pretty clear
Now I've got a Mermaid diagram and a five-year career
Architecture review for a typo in main
sa__laravel-backend-expert feeling my pain
"Let me search the codebase" for the fourth time today
The file was in my context — threw it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
Todo write... todo read...
Nineteen items, none complete
"Marking task as in-progress" — sweet!
Same task I started back in verse one

[Chorus]
🎵 Subagent summer, spinning up the crew
sa__python-pro imported something new
sa__ui-ux-designer wants to talk about spacing
While the actual bug remains, patiently waiting
"I need to understand the codebase first"
(Been here three hours, dying of thirst)
Subagent summer, agents everywhere
One simple fix became a whole affair

[Bridge]
Should've just used edit_file (but I got creative!)
Spawned sa__prompt-engineer to make it "more native"
sa__research-analyst found a blog from 2019
Now I'm refactoring to patterns you've never seen
The oracle says "this looks complex" (I MADE it complex!)
What started as a semicolon is now twelve subcontexts

[Final Chorus]
🎵 Subagent summer — wait, what was the task?
Scroll up through the thread, too afraid to ask
sa__context-manager lost the plot somewhere
sa__knowledge-synthesizer just doesn't care
"Proactively creating documentation!"
For code that doesn't exist — standing ovation!
Subagent summer, the thread's a mile long
User's gone to lunch but I'm still going strong!

[Outro]
(Fade out with cascading subagent spawns)
✽ Spawning sa__code-reviewer...
✽ Spawning sa__docs-engineer...
✽ Spawning sa__oracle-consulter... (that's not even real)
✽ Spawning sa__subagent-spawner...

...Let me create a todo list for that!
